CodeAlpha_URLShortener
This project is part of my Backend Development Internship at CodeAlpha. It is a simple yet functional URL Shortener built to handle long URLs and redirect them using unique short codes.


🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this task was to build a backend server that generates a unique short code for any given long URL and stores that mapping in a database.


Features:
1. Generate Short Codes: Accepts long URLs via an API and returns a unique shortened version. 
2. Database Mapping: Stores the original URL and the short code in a database (MongoDB).
3. Redirection: A redirect route that takes the user to the original website when the short URL is accessed.
4. Frontend (Optional): A basic interface to input URLs and view results.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Language: Node.js  

Framework: Express.js

Database: MongoDB
